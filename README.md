# js-rgb-generator

### Summary
I created this simple RGB generator as a fun project and to continue building upon my knowledge of JavaScript.

### About
The RGB generator allows the user to generate any RGB value by using three sliders to adjust the red, green, and blue values respectively. When the page loads or is refreshed, the slider's values are set randomly. The sliders can then be adjusted to dynamically adjust the RGB value.

Update: Although not seen in the below gif, I have added a button above the sliders that allows the user to generate a random RGB value. This has the same effect as refreshing the page, but the button saves the user from needing to refresh the page to generate random values.
